If connecting to a client's environment from a remote site requires an SSH tunnel, how can we make local HTTP requests to access client resources?  I didn't want to install a system-wide proxy solution that I would only need on an infrequent basis, so I explored [pproxy](https://pypi.org/project/pproxy/) and found it to be exactly what I needed.

When used with dynamic port forwarding over ssh, pproxy can forward localhost HTTP requests through the SOCKS tunnel.  Filters can specify which requests are forwarded through the tunnel, meaning only those requests for resources on the other side of the tunnel are forwarded.  Suppose that a gateway server `remotegateway.somedomain.com` exists which has access to the resources you need, and you can SSH into it.  Here's how to set it up:

First, connect to your remote gateway using dynamic forwarding.  Here I've chosen to forward requests made to port 9300 over the tunnel.

```
ssh -D 9300 myname@remotegateway.somedomain.com
```

To pass only specific requests to the proxy (for example, requests to somedomain.com), first create a rules file for pproxy (e.g., `rules.re`), with content such as:

```
# Forwarded domains
(?:.+\.)?somedomain.*\.com
```

Then, launch the proxy server with those rules:

```
pproxy -r socks5://127.0.0.1:9300?rules.re -vv
```

pproxy is now listening on `localhost:8080`.  It will forward any requests matching your rules to port 9300, which will send them through the tunnel to remotegateway.com.  Any application (browser, Postman, etc) needing to use the tunnel must be configured to use a local proxy listening on `localhost:8080`
