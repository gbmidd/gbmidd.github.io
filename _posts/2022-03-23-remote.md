With all the remote work we've been doing, there has been occasion to mount a remote filesystem on a local machine to make it easier to edit code.  While using `ssh` to connect to a remote machine and then editing in `vi` is possible, we'd much prefer to take advantage of the richer features of an IDE such as [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  IDEs are at their best when they have access to a local filesystem, so we'd like to mount the remote files locally.

On a machine running Gnome, the Files (formerly called, and still launched with, `nautilus`) tool offers an easy way to mount remote drives using the "Other Locations" tab:

  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/posts/remote/n0.png' | relative_url }}" alt="remote" class="full">
</figure>

This would use gvfs to mount an ssh share using my account at mycorp.com.  It would appear as a local folder, which the IDE could access easily.  However, what if the machine I need to access is two hops away?  Suppose I must first log into a jump box to get through a firewall, and from there sign into the target machine?  Is there a way to mount *those* files locally?  Fortunately, there is:

1. Create (or edit) a file called `~/.ssh/config` on your local machine.

2. Add two sets of lines: the first to define the jump box, and the second to interpret an ssh connection request to the target machine:

```bash
Host jumpbox
  HostName 123.45.67.89

Host target-machine
  ProxyCommand ssh -A -t me@jumpbox nc 10.18.1.5
```

3. Connect to the target machine from nautilus:

  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/posts/remote/n1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="remote-jump" class="full">
</figure>

Dialog boxes may appear with password requests, but this is an easy (and secure) way to locally mount files from a remote machine.
