After years of poorly (or not at all) managing my Python development environment, a recent clean install of Ubuntu 20.04 prompted me to try--from the start--to keep my dependencies and versioning clean.

`pip` and `pipenv` are the default solutions used by most developers, but I opted instead for a newer project called [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).  Its ease of use and intuitive commands attracted me initially, but even more key to me is the project's active development state.  Documentation is clear and current, and it handles everything--dependencies, dependencies of dependencies, and virtual environments, in one harmonious manner.
