I'm a knowledge professional living in Northern Colorado, designing and building automation technology for the legal industry.  

I have a PhD in engineering and a BA in economics, and I'm especially interested in the systems-level perspective of a challenge: what's the business need, what solution meets it, and what technology best delivers it?

I enjoy running long distances, maintaining our cars and our home, and cooking dinner with my wife.
